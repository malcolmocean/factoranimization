# factoranimization

Modified from [the original](http://www.datapointed.net/visualizations/math/factorization/animated-diagrams/) for a friend who wanted the animation to be slower.  I don't own the rights to this code but since it's all front-end code it was all sitting there publicly anyway so I made this alternate version.
